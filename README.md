Icepack is a small package I developed for my Co-op research at the Canadian Centre for Climate Change and Analysis (CCCMA) in Victoria, BC, Canada. Its functionality is heavily dependent on `xarray`, `numpy`, and a smattering of other libraries (see `spec-file.txt`).

Refer to the example notebooks `example.ipynb` for a brief tutorial on how this package may be used. Its functionality will be expanded upon in the future, and suggestions/recommendations are welcome and encouraged!
